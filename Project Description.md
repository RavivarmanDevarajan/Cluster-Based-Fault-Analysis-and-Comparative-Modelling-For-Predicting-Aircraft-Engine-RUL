The   ability to accurately predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of aircraft 
engines is crucial for enhancing operational efficiency, minimizing downtime 
and ensuring flight safety. This study integrates Cluster-Based Sensor Trend 
Analysis with Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models to 
develop a robust predictive maintenance framework using C-MAPSS dataset. 


A cluster-based approach is employed to analyse sensor trends, distinguishing 
fault conditions and assessing sensor data as a reliable predictor of fault 
propagation. Advanced feature engineering techniques, including rolling 
statistics and exponential weighted means are applied to enhance data 
representation. Multiple ML and DL models, such as Random Forest, 
XGBoost, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural 
Networks (CNNs) are trained and evaluated for RUL prediction. Model 
performance is assessed using key metrics like Root Mean Squared Error 
(RMSE), R-squared scores and computational efficiency.
